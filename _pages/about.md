Hello, I'm Irene Hou! I'm a first-year [Cognitive Science](https://cogsci.ucsd.edu) PhD student in [The Design Lab](https://designlab.ucsd.edu) at the [University of California, San Diego](https://ucsd.edu) (UCSD), where I am advised by [Dr. Philip Guo](https://pg.ucsd.edu).

My research interests span Human-Computer Interaction, Human-Centered AI, and computing pedagogy. I study how generative AI systems in disciplines such as computing, science, and design can democratize learning and creativity. I'm particularly interested in computing for non-experts and participatory approaches to AI.

Previously, I was a Research Lead in Temple University's HCI Lab, advised by [Dr. Stephen MacNeil](https://stevemacn.github.io), and UX Lead at FluentPet in collaboration with the [Comparative Cognition Lab](https://cclab.ucsd.edu). I received my B.S. from UCSD in Cognitive Science (Design and Interaction) with a minor in Computer Science. Outside of my research, I'm a fiction writer/poet and was one of America's youngest authors at age 14.
