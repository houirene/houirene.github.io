about me
======

Hello, I'm Irene! I'm an incoming PhD student in [Cognitive Science](https://cogsci.ucsd.edu) at the [University of California, San Diego](https://ucsd.edu) (UCSD), advised by [Dr. Philip Guo](https://pg.ucsd.edu). My research interests span human-computer interaction, human-centered AI, and computing pedagogy. I study how large language models (LLMs) and AI-driven systems in disciplines such as computing, science, and design can democratize learning and creativity. I'm particularly interested in learner behavior and participatory approaches to AI.

I'm currently a researcher at Temple University's HCI Lab, where I am advised by [Dr. Stephen MacNeil](https://stevemacn.github.io). Previously, I was UX Lead at FluentPet in collaboration with the [Comparative Cognition Lab](https://cclab.ucsd.edu). I received my Bachelor of Science in Cognitive Science, Design and Interaction and minor in Computer Science from UCSD. Outside of my research, I'm a fiction writer/poet and was one of America's youngest authors at age 14!
